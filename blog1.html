                <p class="has-drop-cap">You probably have watched Youtube videos of this.
                    '#<strong>BillionaireMindset</strong>'. <em>Are you one of those who wakes up early morning?</em>
                    Then you must be enjoying this ritual.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Think of all the morning energy. You woke up at 6 am. Sun is about to rise. You move from your bed,
                    gets to the door, slowly opens it, letting the cool breeze swirl around you, the chirpy sound of the
                    birdsâ€¦</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Waking up early has pretty good benefits.<br>You can well plan the day if you wake up early. You get
                    a lot of time before class/work. </p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The best time to workout is in the morning.<br>Take a long shower you were yearning for, sing a song
                    and dance if you want. <em>Just make sure you don't break your bones</em>. Don't drink the coffee -
                    sip the coffee, it tastes much better. Check your bag even if you don't want to. Learn to iron
                    clothes by yourself. Make to-do lists every day.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><em>No more missing the bus. No more running to the class with a brush in your pocket.</em></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The key to waking up early is to sleep early. The Human body needs 6-7 hours of sleep. It's time for
                    the body to get some rest for all the energy spent in the day.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><em>What is the ideal time to go to bed? When do we go to bed?</em><br>Night-out, late night parties
                    are the current trends. Some stay late due to their work. If you work in IT sector, you probably
                    leaves late from the office.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>A large proportion is immersed in social medias. So many platforms and some people are adamant in
                    using them all. WhatsApp groups forwards countless messages, <em>who reads everything anyway</em>,
                    and the never ending Instagram wall. FB, Twitter, Snapchat and the list goes on. And then there are
                    these love birds whose ideal time to talk over phone is 12 in the night. LOL.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>So let's put up a plan. <strong>Hit bed by 11pm and wake up by 6am.</strong> Make some variations to
                    the time set with what works best for you. Set your alarm.<br>If you woke up on the first day itself
                    then Great! Most probably you will not. Because our body is accustomed to the sleep cycle we
                    followed till day. Breaking it is not easy. If you are determined, you will be up with some efforts
                    within 3-4 days.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Now the harder part is sticking to this routine. <strong>Never ever make an excuse</strong>. Break it
                    once, then it's even more harder to get back in the track. The gym going people knows it. One day
                    they don't show up, then the next day even more lazy they become.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Stick to the routine even if it's Sunday. Work towards your goal. Create a side business. Make two
                    sources of income. If one fails, you can hold on to the other, backup.<br>Sleep well and do well,
                    they are interconnected.<br>Do let me know your suggestions.</p>
