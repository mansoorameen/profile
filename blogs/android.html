            <h1><br>Using The Most From Your Android Mobile</h1>
            <img src="/images/androidmobile.jpg">
            <p>
                <br> <i>Do you actually make full use of your Android mobile? Or is it just making calls, browse
                    internet, social medias, gaming and watch videos? Is that it?
                </i><br><br>
                Android is based on Linux-kernel. Linux OS is used in our computers, web servers and even in ‘super
                computers’. Linux OS is made up of 8 other softwares and Kernel is a small part of the Linux OS. So
                basically Android can do a lot of things.
                That’s why smarphones are called mini-computers.<br><br>

                Let’s split the topic into two.<br><br>


                <h3>1: Making things easier with Apps.</h3><br>

                You know this section as we all use mobile very often. We always use a computer for most of the work
                related stuffs. But they are not handy. Think of mobiles- easy peasy!
                <br><br>

                There are many cool Android applications to help you out. You don’t need a computer to create a
                resume/cv, PDF or posters. If you have a printer you can just print anything to a paper directly from
                your mobile. From text editors,drawings to animation design and illustrations, almost everything.
                <br><br>

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>I did a digital poster design for an assignment work in PDF format using mobile while most people
                    used computer in our batch. Most of us mainly rely on Play Store for downloading apps. But that's
                    not the only play store available. There are many other app stores like <em><a
                            href="http://www.aptoide.com">Aptoide</a></em>, <em><a
                            href="http://www.uptodown.com">Uptodown</a></em>,<em><a href="http://f-droid.org">
                            F-Droid</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/mas/get/android/">Amazon
                            Appstore</a></em> etc. You won't find these in Google Play Store because Google doesn't
                    allow other appstores to be listed in its Store.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Now to my dear coders out there, I assume you have fed up of those C++… coding apps. Coding in mobile
                    is hard as you need to input more symbols. Its better to use a pc. But if you have limited access to
                    the computer and wants to do some quick works, then try this app called <em><a
                            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ansm.anwriter">anWriter</a></em>.
                </p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>It is light weight, most of the tags show up when you type the first word and it automatically shows
                    the closing tags too. The most common symbols are separately shown on the screen so you can easily
                    select it. Good for those who are studying web designing. You can try HTML and JavaScript codes then
                    save it as .html file and open it via any browser.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The main problem of mobile devices is the display size. It is difficult to work on a small display.
                    That's why we move to computers. Of course, computers are really powerful. Some works or apps need
                    high graphics and other utilities which are impossible to be able to run in mobile devices
                    currently.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2: Rooting and Custom ROMs.</span></strong><br>This
                    is the fun part. You don't get full access to your Android mobile by default because normally
                    manufacturers ship them by locking the base structure of the OS. Till now you were only enjoying the
                    berries that are sprinkled over an ice cream. The access to the below layer is gained by a method
                    called rooting.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Android is an open source project, which means anyone can modify the codes. Android has a massive
                    community of developers contributing to its development.<br>In the first section we discussed about
                    running different kinds of app. Here by rooting you can try some cool features and modifications.
                    Ever thought, <br><br><em>'Oh, if I had this option it would be cool'</em>? Or <em>'If i could ever
                        modify this settings'</em>?</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Rooting your mobile opens you to a plethora of customisations. Change colour of notification bar,
                    texts displayed on your screen, position of certain elements like clock, decide which animation you
                    need when moving through app drawer and many other tweaks. You can disable ads shown by apps(PS: ads
                    is how the apps make money, think of all the hardwork they put to create apps) if it is too
                    annoying, move apps to sdcard so you can save internal storage etc. all with rooting. You can even
                    increase the performance of your mobile.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><em>But what if you want to change your Android OS to another version? Still using the same old
                        Android version? The new update for you hasn't come yet?</em> </p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><strong>That doesn't mean you have to stick to the same OS version forever!</strong> This is where
                    Custom ROMs enters the game.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Custom ROM is nothing but Android OS built by other developers other than the one your mobile
                    currently has. ROM(Read Only Memory) is the place where the OS is stored. So Custom ROM means Custom
                    Android OS here.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>These Custom ROMs let us to enjoy the latest Android versions and all its features. Some Custom ROMs
                    boasts rich features and customisations giving its users the best Android experience. Some comes
                    with pure Android and some focus more on performance.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>There are a quite a few awesome ROMs out there. <em><a
                            href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a></em> and <em><a
                            href="https://www.resurrectionremix.com/">Resurrection Remix</a></em> are very popular among
                    them. I'm currently using Lineage OS and it's pretty good.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Note: Rooting and flashing Custom ROM should be done by only those who really knows these stuffs.
                    It's not a big task but one should be technically good enough to do these.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Bring out the most of your device and happy Android exploring.</p>
