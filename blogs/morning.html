                <p class="has-drop-cap">You probably have watched Youtube videos of this.
                    '#<strong>BillionaireMindset</strong>'. <em>Are you one of those who wakes up early morning?</em>
                    Then you must be enjoying this ritual.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
            
                 <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Waking up early has pretty good benefits.<br>You can well plan the day if you wake up early. You get
                    a lot of time before class/work. </p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Think of all the morning energy. You woke up at 6 am. Sun is about to rise. You move from your bed,
                    gets to the door, slowly opens it, letting the cool breeze swirl around you, the chirpy sound of the
                    birdsâ€¦</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->



                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>
                    <br>Take a long shower you were yearning for, sing a song
                    and dance if you want <em>-Just make sure you don't break your bones :)</em>. <br><br>Don't drink the coffee -
                    sip the coffee, it tastes much better. Check your bag even if you don't want to. Learn to iron
                    clothes by yourself. Make to-do lists every day.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><em>No more missing the bus. No more running to the class with a brush in your pocket.</em></p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->
            
             <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The best time to workout is in the morning. Morning workout can kickstart your day with full energy. 
                    You will feel active and no nore drowsy-sleepy faces that you drag on to your work. <br><br>
                    Evenings can make you tired with your office work. But try which time works best for you.
                    Some of my friends likes to workout in the evening, and some choose morning. Depends on you.</p>

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Sound great right? So how do I get up early? What's the magic formula? We all know <em>alarm</em> is kinda joke, because we never wake to it.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>The key to waking up early is to sleep early. Yup, you read it right. The Human body needs 6-7 hours of sleep for all the energy 
                    it spent during the day. And it's simple logic you may think, who doesn't know this?!<br><br>
                    <em>Go on, read more.</em><br> </p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p><em>So what's the ideal time ro sleep?</em>
                    <br>Night-out, late night parties
                    are the current trends. Some stay late due to their work- if you work in IT sector, you know why :).</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>A large proportion is immersed in social medias. So many platforms, and some people are addicted that they can't live without these.<br><br>
                     WhatsApp groups forwards countless messages, <em>who reads everything anyway</em>,
                    and the never ending Instagram wall. <br>FB, Twitter, Snapchat and the list goes on. And then there are
                    these <em>love birds</em> whose ideal time to talk over phone is 2 AM. LOL. (<em>this is why I just reject every proposal :D )</em></p><br?
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                    <p><h3>Okay, now let's put up a plan.</h3><br> <em>Hit bed by 11pm and wake up by 6am.</em><br> Make some variations to
                    the time set with what works best for you. Tell your mom to pour a jar of water if you didn't wake up(that's a joke).<br>
                    <br>If you woke up on the first day itself, then Great! Most probably you will not. <br>Because our body is accustomed to the sleep cycle we
                    followed till today. <br>Breaking it is not easy. If you are determined, you will be up with some efforts
                    within 3-4 days.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                  <p>Now the <em>harder part</em> is sticking to this routine. <strong>Never ever make an excuse</strong>. Break it
                    once, then it's even more harder to get back in the track. The gym bhayyas knows this very well. One day
                    they don't show up, then the next day even more lazy they become.</p>
                <!-- /wp:paragraph -->

                <!-- wp:paragraph -->
                <p>Stick to the routine even if it's Sunday. Work towards your goal. <br>Sleep well and do well,
                    they are interconnected.
